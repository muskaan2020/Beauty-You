				<p>In the forests of Burma, a curious young man looked on, as villagers fed the roots of a local herb to calm a herd of agitated elephants.<br><br>
				That man was Mr. M. Manal, the founder of Himalaya, and that herb was Rauwolfia Serpentina, the inspiration that led to the creation of Serpina®, the world's first natural antihypertensive drug, launched in 1934.<br><br>

				Mr. Manal's dream of discovering the mysteries of nature began in the year 1930. He was determined to bring to people the promise of nature's healing power, harnessed through scientific research.</p>

				<p>Ninety years later, this vision has translated into Himalaya's mission of touching people's lives with the promise of Wellness in every Home and Happiness in every Heart.<br><br><br>

				Himalaya began its journey at a time when herbal products were regarded with skepticism. But, our founder persevered to follow his dreams. Pawning his mother's bangles, he bought a hand-operated tableting machine.</p>
